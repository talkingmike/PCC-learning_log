We'll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to log the topics
they're interested in and to make journal entries as they learn about each
topic. The Learning Log home page should describe the site and invite users
to either registor or log in. Once logged in, a user should be able to create
new topics, add new entires, and read and edit existing entries.
